    <h2>Michelle Gohr</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Michelle. I recently got married to my husband who lives in Utah. I'm from Colorado. We have two adorable dogs.</p>
    <p>I don't know a lot about what I'm doing yet, but I'm having fun!</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the Church since I was 8 and served a mission in the California Santa Rosa mission.</p>
